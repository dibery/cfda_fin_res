__label__1	if economic and political conditions and the market for our products do not continue to improve and our revenues decline our business could be harmed and we may not be able to further reduce our costs to align them with these decreased revenues 
__label__1	regulatory changes may increase our costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products and thus place other entities that are not subject to similar regulation in stronger more favorable competitive positions which could adversely affect our growth and our ability to operate profitably

__label__1	in addition other changes in assumptions about future costs expected to be incurred to service contracts could result in the recognition of additional charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
__label__1	as a result of the decline in our sales and profitability resulting from the impact of the global recession the company negotiated revisions to its debt covenant requirements for fiscal 2010 which will among other things result in higher fees and interest rates charged by our lenders to the company and a reduction in the principal amount available under our revolver to 90000 we believe that these revisions to our debt covenants should address the adverse impact of the recession with respect to our covenant requirements but there can be no assurance that these reductions will be sufficient particularly if the recession is longer or worse than we expect

__label__1	currently access to the capital markets is not a limiting factor however if significant new capital requirements are requested and approved we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all since the availability and terms of financing depend on financial market conditions including the effect of volatility in financial and credit markets changes in availability and cost of capital either due to market conditions or as a result of the utilities credit ratings or interest rate fluctuations 
__label__1	we believe that there are risks arising from doing business with service providers in 24  these markets that may not be faced by our competitors in their relationships with corporate and other customers including  any failure of a service providers service to its customers that it attributes to our products whether or not our products actually failed which could lead to substantial negative publicity and undermine our sales  the low level of brand loyalty demonstrated by service providers which may cause them to switch to another supplier that provides or that they believe provides superior performance or costeffectiveness  the introduction or the planned introduction of new products and product enhancements which could cause service providers to cancel reduce or delay existing orders and  service providers that are heavily dependent upon financing particularly from the high yield debt market to build out their infrastructure who may decrease their infrastructure purchases if interest rates increase or if credit availability in these markets decreases

__label__1	in addition demand in the municipal market is dependent upon the availability of funding at the local level which may be the subject of increasing pressure as local governments are expected to bear a greater share of the cost of public services
__label__1	these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines 
__label__1	for any claims arising during such period that would exceed that level we intend to pursue our legal rights against the insurance agent and its errors and omissions policy but we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available in which case our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
__label__1	however the terms of any new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could materially reduce the operating income and cash flows that we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to further reduce the 3499037 carrying value of our goodwill
